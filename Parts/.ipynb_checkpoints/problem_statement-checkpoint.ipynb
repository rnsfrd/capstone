    "# *How the Infrastructure of a Country Affects the Spread of Disease*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement<a id='problem'></a>\n",
    "The goal of this project is to try and predict transmission rates based on the current infrastructure of a country. 'Infrastructure' will include any indicators/metrics that may have an impact on diseases transmission. This can include metrics on transportation, sanitation, healthcare, food/drug standards, government structure, telecommunication, public health funding, etc. Within each of their categories there are a multitude of sub-indicators, for example healthcare has many indicators such as money spent on lab testing, hospital capacity, number of patients per doctor, cost of medicine, etc. These many indicators will be used to predict the tranmission rate of a disease and map the probable spread of a disease over time given infrastructure metrics of the current and previous years. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology and Models<a id='models'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will specifically focus on countries that show a significant amount of variation within the data using the coeffecient of variation (COV) for the number of reported cases for several diseases as well as countries that have instability in infrastructure. The reason for this is to discover possible novel relationships in developing countries between infrastructure and their transmission rates. We cannot see the effect of infrastructure inputs on transmission rates if the country has very stable infrastructure and number of cases. Countries that are extremely underdeveloped or extremely developed will generally produce overgeneralized results as their infrastructure and transmission rates are relatively stable. I.e., there is nothing novel about saying rich countries have a consistently low number of cases for a disease and poor countries have a consistently high number of cases for a disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem we will be building a time series model as we are studying the effects on spread of a disease over time given changing inputs. We will gather infrastructure data as well as transmission rate data for several diseases and select features intuitively and by studying interactions and relations between variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations<a id='risks'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk and pitfall of this model is that infrastructure data is only available and updated once every year and likely only shows a significant effect on society year to year which means we have a limited subset of data. Also the fact that many developing countries have only started reporting infrastructure and health statistics in the last 2 or 3 decades, also limiting the amount of data we have. This will limit how well our model can predict transmission rates in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to consider is that disease transmission rate also heavily depends on what type of transmission the disease is spread by (i.e. direct contact vs airborne has two very different transmission rates). For this, we will have to include a dummy variable based on the type of transmission. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria<a id='criteria'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of our model will be based on how well our model predicts the transmission rate of a disease at a point in time given the: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Country\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Type of disease\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Infrastructure metrics/inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Year\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally we aim to find relations between inputs that provide insight into which infrastructure inputs affect disease transmission rates versus which inputs do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping<a id='map'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our maps will aim to show the comparison between the recorded data for a country's disease rates by plotting the number of cases in a region and then via user input, how that map would change if certain inputs were changed."
