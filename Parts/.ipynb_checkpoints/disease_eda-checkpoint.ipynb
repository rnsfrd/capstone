    "## Disease Transmission Rate Regression: *How infrastructure of a country affects the spread of disease*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal of this project is to try and predict how fast a disease will spread based on the current infrastructure of a country. 'Infrastructure' will include any indicators/metrics that may have an impact on diseases transmission. This can include metrics on transportation, sanitation, healthcare, food/drug standards, government structure, telecommunication, public health funding, etc. Within each of their categories there are a multitude of sub-indicators, for example healthcare has many indicators such as money spent on lab testing, hospital capacity, number of patients per doctor, cost of medicine, etc. These many indicators will be used to predict the tranmission rate of a disease and map the probable spread of a disease over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Models\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem we will be building a time series model as we are studying the effects on spread of a disease over time given changing inputs. We will gather infrastructure data as well as transmission rate data for several diseases, and perform EDA and select features intuitively and by plotting relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk and pitfall of this model is that infrastructure data is only available and updated once every year and likely only shows a significant effect on society year to year. The rate of change for infrastructure is significantly less than the rate of change for transmission rates. The way it is set up is that we would have to regress all our indicators on the yearly transmission rate which isn't as fast/reactive a model as we liked. Tranmission rates vary from country to country, some are fairly flat for a disease, some are exponential and people are concerned with day to day, week to week transmission rates. One way we can get around this is by including a 'days since first case' variable when including transmission data. So we can aim to collect 30 day, 60 day, 90 day, 6 month, and yearly benchmarks for the transmission rates then include that time feature as a critical part of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to consider is that disease transmission rate also heavily depends on what type of transmission the disease is spread by (i.e. direct contact vs airborne has two very different transmission rates). For this, we will have to include a dummy variable based on the type of transmission. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of our model will be based on how well our model predicts the transmission rate of a disease at a point in time given the: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Country\n",
    "2) Type of disease\n",
    "3) Infrastructure metrics/inputs\n",
    "4) Year\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create two maps, one that plots the number of cases on a map given the country, disease, and year which can be adjusted via user inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second map will contain the same inputs except with infrastructure sliders so the user can see what the number of cases might look like given a change in spending in a particular metric."

These countries will provide us with a smaller scope as to which regions we want to investigate. Exploring the world will most likely produce very general results (i.e., countries with more hospitals have less cases of Ebola) and studying countries that are relatively stable in terms of cases likely have stable infrastructure. The goal of this project will be to show that countries with volatile number of cases per year and volatile infrastructure need to stick to plan 'X Y or Z' in order to stabilize and minimize the number of cases for ad disease.\n",

The reason for this is because countries who have a relatively stable number of cases per year likely did not undergo much change in their healthcare infrastructure. For example, many 1st world countries have stable infrastructure and stable health care systems. The data is unlikely to be very volatile especially for the diseases being studied that have been around for some time. \n",
